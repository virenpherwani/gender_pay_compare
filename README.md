# Visualization project - Pay Comparison by Gender for US Managers

## Summary

	The intent of the project is to compare average weekly pay for women
	with that of men as it changes with time. The same graph also displays number of women
	and men in the workforce, and allows the user to compare it and understand how 
	it has changed with time.
	
## Design
	
###	Chart type
	I wanted to compare both the count and pay for men Vs women. A normal bar chart would not
	allow me to compare both metrics at the same time. To compare both variables I decided to 
	compare rectangles where both the width and height change. I also wanted these to be centered 
	around the center of the screen for the comparison to stand out. It was more important for 
	me to compare the metrics for women to men, than to compare data from one year to the next.
	So I did not depict the years on the chart.
	
###	Animation
	I wanted to include animation to draw the users attention to change in metrics. I realized 
	that the count of men and women managers were equal and did not change much. The pay scale 
	for men grew faster than that for women, and that was brought out well by animation.
	
###	Chart colors
	To draw the users attention to the comparison of metrics, I decided to keep these in blue 
	shade, and keep non important information on the chart in gray. After the initial review, 
	I decided to add a data point for each year, and plotted these in max blue color, in order 
	that they stand out.
	
###	Finding
	The data drives the point that over years the count of men and women managers in the 
	US has increased significantly, and so has their average pay. However, the pay gender 
	gap hasn't changed. The ratio of the average pay of women to that of men is still the same.
	
	Design - In order to clearly display this finding over the years, I decided to clearly display
	this ratio for each of the years. These are added as the animation progresses.
	

## Feedback

###	User 1 - for initial version
	1. It is very difficult to notice changes from one quarter to the other, even during an animation. Would be better to show changes from one year to the next.
	2. Display the pay gender ratio clearly to clarify the finding.
	3. Need these changes to make the visualization pop out and be more noticeable.

###	User 2 - for updated version
	1. The visualization is OK. Here are a couple of suggestions for alternate visuals
		a. Use a slider to view changes from one year to another instead of a drop down.
		b. Use a bubble chart to show growth in pay across the years. Show two bubbles for each year with the bubble size indicating the pay.
###	User 3 - for updated version
	1. Animation looks good. Here are a couple of suggestions for alternate visuals
		a. Display all 10years data in a single heat or pie chart. Clicking on one of the elements displays the pay for each of the sexes.This will allow additional colors on the chart, and will garner attention.
###	Initial udacity review
	1. Allow the user to conveniently compare the metrics across the years.
	2. Include a statement in the chart to direct the user to the finding.
	3. Describe design considerations in more detail
	4. Include the previous version of the chart.
	
## Actions taken on feedback
	1. Animation was changed to display changes annually.
	2. The pay gender ratio was displayed clearly on the chart.	
	3. Suggestions from other users were not considered for now, as they distract from the point of a 'sticky' gender pay ratio.

## Actions taken after udacity review		
	1. Displayed data points for each year on the chart for comparison across years.
	2. Displayed pay ratio for each year to draw the users attention to the finding.
	3. Elaborated on design considerations.
	4. Included previous version.
